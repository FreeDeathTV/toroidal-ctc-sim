## Summary

This project simulates closed timelike curve (CTC) behavior using spin-biased wave propagation in a toroidal FDTD system. By introducing a rotating refractive index perturbation, it induces directional time-of-flight asymmetries—analogous to relativistic frame dragging—within a classical waveguide.

The simulation outputs reproducible arrival-time shifts across a sweep of angular velocities (Ω), visualized through plots and animations. It serves as a desktop analogue for exploring delay-based logic, recursive computation, and metaphysical implications of time-loop dynamics.

The codebase is modular, reproducible, and built for open science. All parameters are JSON-configured, results are exported to CSV, and the CLI supports clean experimentation. Documentation is included for both technical and public audiences.

## Statement of Need

There is growing interest in analogues for exotic spacetime phenomena using classical systems. This project provides a reproducible, open-source framework for simulating directional delay in closed-loop waveguides—useful for researchers exploring delay-based logic, metaphysical modeling, or educational demonstrations of time-loop analogues.
